      <h1>Birth Unto Me</h1>
      <p>Pregnancy is the only time in my life when I have felt my fullest self.
      <h2>Mothering Yourself</h2>
      </p> To be the only one left to mother, the only one who outwardly identified you as such.
      <h3>Azure's Wisdom</h3>
      <p>My daughter propelled me to do so many things that I was holding back on or afraid to do. The veneer I used to meet
          the world with has been wiped away, my core no longer allows bs to seep through.
      <h3>Why I Code</h3>
         </p> In my first grad school course, named Internet and Computer Fraud, our professor introduced us to the terminal. I've been hooked since then
         wanting to learn all there was about coding, programming, etc. I wanto to be able to build programs, challenge systems, and gather input. I'm a writer
         first and foremost, and coding contains many languages I would like to learn and contribute to.
