      <div class="intro">
      <p>Pregnancy is the only time in my life when I have felt my fullest self.There's a peace to that process that both evened out my personality and sharpened parts of it to perfection. The Zahon before, and the Zahon that remains are two people on very opposite sides of the sepctrum. For better or worse, there is no turning back, only an inchorent amalgamation of moving parts that comprise the future.</p>

         <h2>Mothering Yourself</h2>
      </p> To be the only one left to mother, the only one who outwardly identified you as such is an isolating and familiar feeling.

      <h3>Azure's Wisdom</h3>
      <p>My daughter propelled me to do so many things that I was holding back on or afraid to do. The veneer I used to meet
          the world with has been wiped away, my core no longer allows bs to seep through.
      <h4>Why I Code</h4>
          <div class="funParagraph">
         <p id="testP">In my first grad school course, named Internet and Computer Fraud, our professor introduced us to the terminal. I've been hooked since then
         wanting to learn all there was about coding, programming, etc. I tried to go the self-taught route but nothing seemed to stick. That's why I'm so grateful for the opportunity that Launchcode provides, with structure and support all around. I want to be able to build programs, challenge systems, and gather input. I'm a writer
         first and foremost, and coding contains many languages I would like to learn and contribute to.</p>

            <h5>Random Thought</h5> I saw on a LinkedIn post the other day that you should hide the phrase "I appreciate you"
            in your code for the next coder/programmer/developer/engineer to find. It's a corny concept but I will definitely
            be doing that sporadically to make someone's day. I know how often I get frustrated writing,debugging, or even just reading code. 
            It would definitely make me stop and smile, and possibly calm down to see such a thoughtful, albeit corny, message.
